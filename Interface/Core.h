 *
 * @param point The point of new move piece in the gobang game board. [point.i] represents the
 *              row index, and [point.j] represents the column index of the point. Both of the
 *              indexes should be a valid integer, i.e. in the range of [0, CORE_BOARD_SIZE - 1],

 *              point will not be added to the gobang game. In this case nothing will change.
 *
 * @param tag The tag of the specific gobang game. If the gobang game with such tag already exists,
 *            the new move piece will be added to it directly. Otherwise a new gobang game with the
 *            specific tag will be created, and then the new move piece will be added. One exception
 *            is that if the total count of gobang game already reaches the maximum count, one of the
 *            gobang games created before will be removed directly to make space for the new gobang
 *            game. You can remove the useless gobang game manually to prevent this from happening.
